            We met at the <strong>Santuario de la Inmaculada Conception Parish,</strong> where I was captivated by your beauty. 
            When I first saw you, it was like I found a priceless gem. While I was singing in the choir loft, I was captivated as 
            you served at the altar. Suddenly I felt something strange, a feeling that my dream had come true. When I saw you, 
            it was like I saw my future in you.

            <strong>Our first official date - </strong>We went to SM Telabastagan and had a picture taken at a studio and then 
            we went to Holy Angel University to celebrate University Days. We walked around and ate musubi. We also watched a 
            concert by one of my favorite artists, Johnoy Danao "Ikaw at ako." And after everything, we went to Lala Garden and 
            had coffee with my family.

            <strong>Baguio Trip - </strong> One of our happiest vacations was going to Baguio city, we went to different attractions 
            there and laughed. As I see your smiles, I see my life in you. Bonus factor is also that my family is there with us and 
            they showed how supportive they are for our relationship.

            <strong>Dungan - </strong> One of our favorite spots where we chill, talk about life, and visualize our future.

            <strong>Talimundoc San Miguel - Corazon De Jesus - </strong> The place where we entered a new chapter (courting stage). 
            This is the place where I played a song for you and played a video to ask your permission if I can court you. Talimundoc 
            SM also serves as a place where we stroll.

            <strong>San Vicente Calius - </strong> Probably my favorite spot! This is the place where we usually eat chicken fillet

            <strong>Meeting You Always - </strong> It became a routine for us to meet everyday, despite our heavy and tiring day, we will still make time
            to meet always. Regardless of my evening classes, I will still reserve energy to be with you even for a short period of time. YOU WILL ALWAYS
