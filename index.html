        <p>We met at the <strong>Santuario de la Inmaculada Conception Parish,</strong> where I was captivated by your beauty. When I first saw you, it was like I found a priceless gem.
            While I was singing in the choir loft, I was captivated as you served at the altar. Suddenly I felt something strange, a feeling that my dream had come true. When I
            saw you, it was like I saw my future in you.</p>

        <p><strong>Our first official date - </strong>We went to SM Telabastagan and had a picture taken at a studio and then we went to Holy Angel University to celebrate University Days. 
            We walked around and ate musubi. We also watched a concert by one of my favorite artists, Johnoy Danao "Ikaw at ako." And after everything, we went to Lala Garden and 
            had coffee with my family.</p>

        <p><strong>Baguio Trip - </strong> One of our happiest vacations was going to Baguio city, we went to different attractions there and laughed. As I see your smiles, I see my life in you. 
            Bonus factor is also that my family is there with us and they showed how supportive they are for our relationship.</p>

        <p><strong>Dungan - </strong> One of our favorite spots where we chill, talk about life, and visualize our future. The place where I taught you how to drive "roxrox." 
            A very imporatant place that I will keep in my heart.</p>

        <p><strong>Talimundoc San Miguel - Corazon De Jesus - </strong> The place where we entered a new chapter (courting stage). This is the place where 
            I played a song for you and played a video to ask your permission if I can court you. Talimundoc SM also serves as a place where we stroll.</p>

        <p><strong>San Vicente Calius - </strong> Probably my favorite spot! This is the place where we usually eat chicken fillet that we bought from plaza. 
            "Tambays" also happen here where we just chill, talk, and admire the beauty of nature.</p>
