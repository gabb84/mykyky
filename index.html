            We met at the <strong>Santuario de la Inmaculada Concepción Parish,</strong> where I was captivated by your beauty. 
            When I first saw you, it felt like I had found a priceless gem. While I was singing in the choir loft, I couldn’t help but be mesmerized as 
            you served at the altar. Suddenly, I felt something strange a feeling that my dream had came true. When I saw you, it was as if I saw my future in you.

            <strong>Our First Official Date – </strong> We went to SM Telabastagan and had our picture taken at a studio. 
            After that, we went to Holy Angel University to celebrate University Days. We walked around, ate musubi, and even watched a 
            concert by one of my favorite artists, Johnoy Danao, performing "Ikaw at Ako." After everything, we went to Lala Garden and 
            had coffee with my family.

        <p>
            <strong>Baguio Trip – </strong> One of our happiest vacations was when we went to Baguio City. We visited different attractions 
            and laughed endlessly. As I see you smile, I see a life with you. The bonus part was having my family there with us, 
            showing how supportive they are of our relationship.

    <div class="text3">
        <p>
            <strong>Dungan – </strong> One of our favorite spots to chill, talk about life, and imagine our future. 
            It’s also the place where I taught you how to drive “roxrox.” This spot will always hold a special place in my heart.

        <p>
            <strong>Talimundoc San Miguel – Corazon De Jesus – </strong> This was the place where we entered a new chapter: the courting stage. 
            It’s where I played a song and showed you a video, asking for your permission to court you. Talimundoc SM also became one of our favorite places to stroll.

            <strong>San Vicente Calius – </strong> Probably my favorite spot! This is where we usually ate chicken fillet that we bought from the plaza. 
            We also had our “tambays” here like chilling, talking, and admiring the beauty of nature.

            <strong>SM Pampanga and Sky Ranch – </strong> I had so much fun here, especially since we were with my family. 
            We went to different stores, ate together, and then headed to Sky Ranch where we rode the Field Runner and Pampanga’s Eye. 
            SUPER FUN!!

            <strong>Meeting You Always – </strong> It became our routine to meet every day. Despite long, tiring days, we always made time 
            for each other. Even with my evening classes, I would still have the energy to be with you, even just for a short while. 
            You will always be my “pahinga.”
